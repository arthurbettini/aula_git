<h2>An Ex-NASA Chief is Making Chips That Use The Same Biological Principles As The Brain</h2>


<p>Ex-NASA Chief Dan Goldin has revealed his company KnuEdge, which develops neural chips that follow the principles
of the human brain and produces voice recognition and authentication technology.</p>

<p>After almost 10 years of working incognito, former National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
head Daniel Goldin is finally ready to formally present KnuEdge to the world.</p>

<p>KnuEdge is a “neural technology innovation company,” an outfit that builds hardware and software
based on neural technology, with a main focus on human-machine interaction. While newly revealed publicly, 
it has been in stealth mode for a decade now, and has already raised $100 million in funding to build its neural chips.</p>

<p>The company has revealed its two primary products: KnuVerse, which is a voice authentication technology,
and KnuPath, its state-of-the-art neural chip. It has also unveiled Knurld.io, a software development kit 
with a cloud-based voice recognition and authentication service.</p>

<p>Apple announced that the new iOS 10 will come with Swift Playgrounds, which would teach kids 
to code “in a seriously fun way.”</p>

<p>Apple believes that coding is an essential skill, with their slogan “Everyone Can Code,” they think…well, 
that everyone can learn the basics of coding—and that everyone should.</p>

<p>Swift Playgrounds introduces kids to coding using a graphical and playful interface that challenges 
the user with puzzles and goals to keep it entertaining, much like a game. 
A special keyboard with shortcuts and features will aid in making it as easy as it is fun.</p>

<p>Pre-made templates are available to demonstrate advanced codes, and an additional feature allows sharing and editing projects through Mail, Messages, or Airdrop. 
You can also import and export between Mac toolkit and Playgrounds.</p> 

<p>Swift Playground is now open source, with the developer preview already out and the final version that
comes with the new iOS 10 free of charge.</p>
